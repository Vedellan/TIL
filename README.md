It's for my game, doesn't have any title yet. 

It's my first repository. I'm just have started Github, even though I singed Up long ago. I didn't speak and write English well because I'm korean. My code will be disordered, hard to see maybe. Well... Good luck for me. 

Oh, I forgot to say. I always get a feedback of my English sentance and word, not only my code. Thanks.
